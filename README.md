# YouTube Video Downloader üé¨

A simple yet powerful Python script that allows you to download YouTube videos directly from your terminal. Paste a URL, choose a save location, and let the script handle the rest. It's built to be reliable, user-friendly, and cross-platform.

This tool uses `yt-dlp` for robust and up-to-date downloading capabilities and `Tkinter` for a native file dialog, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The script takes a YouTube video URL as input. It then uses `yt-dlp` to fetch the video information and download the highest quality stream that is compatible with most video players (like QuickTime, VLC, and Windows Media Player). A graphical folder selection dialog, created with `Tkinter`, allows the user to specify a download location.

The key dependency, **FFmpeg**, is used in the background by `yt-dlp` to merge the high-quality video and audio streams into a single, playable file.

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

To get this script running on your local machine, you'll need Python 3 and the FFmpeg utility. Follow the steps below for your operating system.

--- 

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

- First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git.
- git clone https://github.com/Yezdani01/Youtube-video-downloader.git
- cd Youtube-video-downloader


### Step 2: Set Up a Python Virtual Environment

- It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to keep project dependencies isolated.

# Create the virtual environment
- python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate the environment
# On macOS/Linux:
- source .venv/bin/activate

# On Windows (Command Prompt):
- .\.venv\Scripts\activate


### Step 3: Install Python Dependencies
- With the virtual environment active, install the required Python library.
- pip install yt-dlp


### Step 4: Install FFmpeg (Crucial Step!)

- yt-dlp requires the FFmpeg tool to merge video and audio files. This is not a Python package and must be installed separately.
- For macOS Users (via Homebrew) üçé
- The easiest way to install FFmpeg on a Mac is with Homebrew.
- Install Homebrew (if you don't have it):

- /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"


# Install FFmpeg:

- brew install ffmpeg

# For Windows Users üíª

### Download FFmpeg: 
- Go to the FFmpeg official download page and click the Windows icon. Use one of the recommended build links (e.g., "Windows builds by BtbN"). Download the latest ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl.zip file.

### Extract FFmpeg: 
- Create a folder at a simple location (e.g., C:\FFmpeg). Extract the contents of the downloaded ZIP file into this folder.

### Add FFmpeg to Windows PATH:

- Search for "Environment Variables" in the Start Menu and select "Edit the system environment variables".
- Click the "Environment Variables..." button.
- In the "System variables" section, find and select the Path variable, then click "Edit...".
- Click "New" and add the path to the bin folder inside your FFmpeg directory (e.g., C:\FFmpeg\bin).
- Click OK on all windows to save the changes.
- Verify the installation: Open a new Command Prompt and type:
- ffmpeg -version

- If it shows version information, you're all set.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use

- Once everything is set up, running the script is easy:
- Make sure your virtual environment is active.
- Run the youtube.py script from your terminal:

- python youtube.py

- Paste the YouTube URL into the terminal when prompted and press Enter.
- A folder selection dialog will appear. Choose where you want to save the video and click "Open" or "Select Folder".

- The download progress will be displayed in the terminal. Once complete, you'll find the video file in your selected folder!
